        <h2>Let's first understand what phishing is</h2>
        <p>Phishing is a form of cyber attack where scammers impersonate legitimate entities, such as banks, companies, or government agencies, to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identification details. This is often done through deceptive emails, text messages, or phone calls that appear to be from trusted sources. Phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and other forms of fraud.</p>

        <h2>What is a scam?</h2>
        
        <p>A scam is a deceptive or fraudulent scheme designed to trick individuals or organizations into providing money, sensitive information, or other valuable assets under false pretenses. Scams can take various forms, including fraudulent investment schemes, fake job offers, romance scams, lottery scams, and phishing attempts, among others. The goal of a scam is typically to exploit the trust, naivety, or vulnerabilities of the victim in order to obtain financial gain or personal information for illicit purposes. Scammers often use sophisticated tactics and manipulative techniques to convince their targets to part with their money or sensitive data. It's important to be cautious and skeptical of unsolicited offers or requests, and to verify the legitimacy of any communication or opportunity before taking action.</p>
